# libp2p projects

This repo tracks specifications for sub-projects within the libp2p project.  We call these sub-projects **work packages** because their requirements are specified in issues and ready for implementors to pick up.

Please check the [issues](issues) for work packages that are ready for implementation, or to discuss work packages that are still under development.
