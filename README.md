# libp2p projects

This repo tracks proposals for sub-projects that would add functionality to the libp2p project.  We call these sub-projects work packages, projects or proposals (interchangeable terms).  Their key charactertistic is that requirements are clearly specified in issues in this repo, and thus are ready for implementors to pick up.

## How to use this repo

Proposals for new sub-projects are specified as [Issues](issues) in this repo. Open issues can be marked with one of three statuses:

- **In Progress** - The issue is still being refined.  It is not ready for an implementor to start work.
- **Ready** - The issue is ready for an implementor to start work.  In some cases, the proposal in the issue has a monetary bounty offered by the libp2p project, Protocol Labs, or another financial backer who wants to see the feature implemented in libp2p.
- **In Development** - Implementation of the proposal in the issue has already started.

## How to implement a project

Find a **Ready** issue in this repo and claim it (add a comment).  Be sure to mention your expected completion date so core maintainers can plan for code review.  We will change the status to **In Development** and you may begin work.

## How to write a proposal

This repo's [issue template](issue_template.md) provides a standardized format for making these proposals.
