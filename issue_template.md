One paragraph explanation of the proposal.

# What is the proposal?
[what]: #what

This section explains _what_ you are proposing. For example:  We propose to build an integration test framework for libp2p that does x, y and z.

As much as possible, try to explain what the proposal is in terms of examples of how it would be used.  If you are adding a new interface, provide code examples of how users would call the interface and what it would do for them.

# How will the proposal be achieved?
[how]: #how

This section explains _how_ you propose that the feature be implemented.

Remember that this is a proposal document and is not intended to spell out every detail of implementation. Depending on what you are proposing, you may want to describe a few parts of the desired implementation in great detail, but leave most parts to the cretivity of the implementor.

This format was inspired by the [Rust RFC process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rust-lang/rfcs/master/0000-template.md).  (You can omit this section from your proposal.)
